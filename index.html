    <p>Lions are currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML is cool</li>
      <li>CSS is cooler</li>
      <li>JS is the best</li>
    </ol>
  <div>
    <h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Not much!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Follow my progress on github</p>
